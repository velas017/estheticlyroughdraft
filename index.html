                    <h4>Hi, I'm Amy Ly, </h4> 
                    <p>A 22-year-old Cambodian-American born and raised in Charlotte, NC. When I'm not in the treatment room, you'll often find me at the gym, enjoying strength training and staying active. I also have a passion for creating customized chocolate-covered strawberry treats, a business I've proudly run since 2020. </p>
                     <p>As a licensed esthetician, I began my solo journey in 2023 with a focus on delivering personalized facials tailored to each client's unique skin type, concerns, and goals. With over 10 certifications, including expertise in chemical peels, dermaplaning, sanitation, and more, I prioritize science-based, corrective skincare. While I don't offer med spa services, my main goal is to provide a safe, relaxing, and comfortable environment for every client. </p>
                    <p>Whether you're looking to start a skincare routine at home or need hands-on care in the treatment room, I'm here to support you. I welcome all skin types and concerns, offering guidance without judgment. My focus is on helping you build a skincare routine that works for your individual needs, with the right ingredients to achieve healthy, glowing skin.</p>

                        <div class="info-content">
                            <p>I've struggled in my own skin for years with stubborn acne figuring out what works for my skin because products aren't a “one size fits all”. I focus on helping others love & be confident in their skin. My goal is for my clients to achieve healthy skin by using active ingredients to treat the skin but still allowing maximum relaxation. I also prioritize necessary lifestyle changes especially internally to address the cause of any skin issues. Remember, <strong><i>healthy skin is perfect skin.</i></strong> </p>

It is a process and being consistent is the best way to see optimal results. If you have any specific concerns, it will help us get to the goal quicker.</li>
