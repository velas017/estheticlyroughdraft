                    <h4>Hi, I'm Amy Ly, </h4> 
                    <p>A 22-year-old Cambodian-American born and raised in Charlotte, NC. When I'm not in the treatment room, you'll often find me at the gym, enjoying strength training and staying active. I also have a passion for creating customized chocolate-covered strawberry treats, a business I've proudly run since 2020. </p>
                     <p>As a licensed esthetician, I began my solo journey in 2023 with a focus on delivering personalized facials tailored to each client's unique skin type, concerns, and goals. With over 10 certifications, including expertise in chemical peels, dermaplaning, sanitation, and more, I prioritize science-based, corrective skincare. While I don't offer med spa services, my main goal is to provide a safe, relaxing, and comfortable environment for every client. </p>
                    <p>Whether you're looking to start a skincare routine at home or need hands-on care in the treatment room, I'm here to support you. I welcome all skin types and concerns, offering guidance without judgment. My focus is on helping you build a skincare routine that works for your individual needs, with the right ingredients to achieve healthy, glowing skin.</p>

                        <div class="info-content">
                            <p>I've struggled in my own skin for years with stubborn acne figuring out what works for my skin because products aren't a “one size fits all”. I focus on helping others love & be confident in their skin. My goal is for my clients to achieve healthy skin by using active ingredients to treat the skin but still allowing maximum relaxation. I also prioritize necessary lifestyle changes especially internally to address the cause of any skin issues. Remember, <strong><i>healthy skin is perfect skin.</i></strong> </p>

                <h4 class="before-items">How to prep for a facial:</h4>
                <ul class="tip-list">
                  <li>Discard use of any retinol or acids for a week, no exfoliating 3 days prior as it can make the skin sensitive</li>
                  <li>Avoid waxing or tanning for 24 hours </li>
                  <li>Try to avoid heavy makeup as much as possible but it's not a hassle, I will remove it. </li>
                  <li>Remove any necklaces</li>
                  <li>Get cozy! Remove shoes, undress waist up (robe is provided), all to personal comfort level</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="before-items">Can I still get a facial while on…?</h4>
                <ul class="tip-list">
                    <li>Contraindications of a facial will be tretinoin, accutane (must stop use for 6 months)</li>
                    <li>No injections, botox, laser, etc. for a month. </li>
                    <li>Reach out for further information if you are using any prescribed medication from a dermatologist.</li>
                    <li>I do work with inflamed acne but there are different stages. I am not a dermatologist so I cannot diagnose your skin but I would recommend a dermatologist for any serious skin conditions. </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="before-items">I don't know what products to use at home. What should I look for?</h4>
                <ul class="tip-list">
                    <li>Having a consultation and skin analysis will guide us into the correct at home routine. This will allow me to see your skin type and start you on the right journey, which is important to know what you are doing already.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="before-items">What should I expect during my first facial?</h4>
                <ul class="tip-list">
                    <li>Expect thorough questions in the beginning so I know what we are working with. I can go step by step in depth with each product we are using and why. </li>
                    <li>Double cleanse, exfoliate, extract if needed, mask, mask (neck and shoulder massage), serums, moisturizer.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="before-items">Do I have to undress?</h4>
                <ul class="tip-list">
                    <li>Undressing waist up is optional, it is to your comfort level. This helps with getting the neck and shoulder area, but not required.</li>
                </ul>

            <ul class="tip-list">
                <li>Recommended every 4-8 weeks as the skin cycle renews itself to remove dead skin to maintain and promote cell turnover and collagen production, improves skin texture. It is a process and being consistent is the best way to see optimal results. If you have any specific concerns, it will help us get to the goal quicker.</li>
